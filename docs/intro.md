# Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook! This comprehensive course bridges the gap between digital AI (LLMs/Agents) and physical embodiment (Robots), teaching you how to create embodied intelligence systems.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into four core modules:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2, Nodes, rclpy, URDF)
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo Physics, Unity Rendering, Sensors)
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac Sim, VSLAM, Nav2)
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (OpenAI Whisper, LLM Cognitive Planning)

Each module builds upon the previous ones, taking you from basic ROS 2 concepts to advanced humanoid robotics applications.

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to learn the fundamentals of ROS 2, then progress through each module at your own pace. The Vector AI assistant is available throughout your learning journey to answer questions and provide guidance.
