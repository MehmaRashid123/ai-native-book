# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac Sim)

This module focuses on NVIDIA's Isaac Sim platform, which combines physics simulation with advanced rendering to create highly realistic digital twins for AI development.

## What You'll Learn

- NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Omniverse platform
- Universal Scene Description (USD) for scene representation
- Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- Navigation 2 (Nav2) for robot path planning
- GPU-accelerated simulation for AI training

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of simulation concepts from Module 2
- Access to RTX-enabled GPU (recommended)

## Important Hardware Note

⚠️ **Warning**: NVIDIA Isaac Sim requires an RTX-enabled GPU with at least 12GB VRAM for optimal performance. If you don't have compatible hardware, consider using cloud-based solutions.

## Getting Started

Let's explore how AI and robotics converge in Isaac Sim.
