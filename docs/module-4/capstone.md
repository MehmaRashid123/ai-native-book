# Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid

The capstone project brings together all concepts learned throughout the course to create an autonomous humanoid robot capable of understanding natural language commands and executing complex tasks.

## What You'll Learn

- Integration of all previous modules
- Building complete robotic systems
- Real-world deployment considerations
- Advanced AI-robotics integration

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of all previous modules
- Experience with ROS 2, simulation, and AI integration

## Project Overview

In this capstone project, you will design and implement an autonomous humanoid robot that can:
- Understand natural language commands through speech recognition
- Plan actions using LLM-based cognitive planning
- Navigate and interact with the environment
- Execute complex multi-step tasks

## Implementation Steps

1. System architecture design
2. Integration of perception, planning, and control systems
3. Testing in simulation
4. Deployment considerations for real hardware
