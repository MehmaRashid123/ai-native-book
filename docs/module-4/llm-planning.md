# LLM Cognitive Planning

Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used for high-level cognitive planning in robotics, enabling robots to understand complex tasks and generate action sequences.

## What You'll Learn

- Integration of LLMs with robotic systems
- Task decomposition and planning
- Natural language interfaces for robots
- Cognitive architectures for embodied AI

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of Vision-Language-Action concepts
- Basic knowledge of neural networks

## LLMs in Robotics

Large Language Models can serve as cognitive controllers for robots, interpreting high-level commands and generating sequences of actions to achieve complex goals...

## Planning with LLMs

LLMs can decompose complex tasks into simpler subtasks that can be executed by robotic systems.
