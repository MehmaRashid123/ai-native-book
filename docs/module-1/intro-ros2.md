# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to the foundation of robotics - the Robot Operating System (ROS 2). In this module, you'll learn how robots communicate and coordinate their actions through a distributed network of nodes, topics, and services.

## What You'll Learn

- The fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture
- How to create and manage ROS 2 nodes
- The publisher-subscriber communication pattern
- Using `rclpy` for Python-based robot control
- Robot Description Format (URDF) for robot modeling

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of object-oriented programming concepts
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces

## Getting Started

Let's begin by understanding what makes ROS 2 the "nervous system" of modern robots.
