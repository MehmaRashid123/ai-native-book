# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo)

In this module, you'll explore the world of robotics simulation, where physical robots are mirrored in digital environments. Simulation is crucial for testing algorithms safely before deploying them on real hardware.

## What You'll Learn

- Gazebo physics simulation engine
- Collision detection and response
- Sensor modeling and simulation
- Unity rendering for visual fidelity
- Creating realistic environments for robot testing

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of ROS 2 concepts from Module 1
- Basic knowledge of physics (forces, motion, collision)

## Getting Started

Let's dive into the physics that make digital twins behave like their real-world counterparts.
