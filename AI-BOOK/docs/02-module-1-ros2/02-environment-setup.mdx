## Environment Setup: Installing ROS 2 Humble

This guide will walk you through installing ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04. This is a critical step to prepare your machine for robotics development.

### 1. Locale Setup

First, ensure your system supports UTF-8. This is a common requirement for ROS 2.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

### 2. Add ROS 2 Repositories

Next, we'll add the official ROS 2 package repositories to your system. This allows `apt` to find and install ROS 2 packages.

```bash
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe

sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
```

### 3. Installation

Now, we can install ROS 2 Humble. We will install the `ros-humble-desktop` package, which includes ROS, RViz, demos, and tutorials.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
```

### 4. Environment Setup

After installation, you need to "source" the ROS 2 setup file in your shell. This script adds ROS 2 commands to your environment.

:::danger
You must run this command in every new terminal you open! If you forget this step, ROS 2 commands like `ros2 run` will not work.
:::

```bash
# Source the setup file
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

To make this permanent, you can add this command to your shell's startup script (e.g., `~/.bashrc`).
```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### 5. Verification

Let's verify that our installation is working. We'll run a simple talker/listener demo.

Open two terminals. In the first terminal, run the "talker" node:
```bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
```
You should see output indicating that it is publishing messages.

In the second terminal, run the "listener" node:
```bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener
```
You should see the messages being received from the talker. Congratulations, you have a working ROS 2 installation!
