## Introduction to Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to the foundational module of your journey into Physical AI. Here, we build the nervous system of our robot using the Robot Operating System (ROS 2).

### Physical AI vs. Generative AI

In the world of AI, you've likely encountered Generative AI like ChatGPT, which excels at understanding and creating text and images. This is intelligence in the digital realm.

Physical AI, however, is about **Embodied Intelligence**. It's the intelligence required for a physical body to interact with the world. This means understanding physics, gravity, friction, and the unpredictable nature of reality. A robot doesn't just process data; it must perceive, move, and act within a physical space. That is the core of what we will build.

### What is ROS 2?

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is the "middleware" or the "glue" that connects a robot's hardware and software. Think of it as the central nervous system of the robot:

-   **Sensors (Eyes & Ears):** ROS 2 takes in data from cameras, LiDAR, and other sensors.
-   **Actuators (Muscles):** It sends commands to motors and other actuators to produce movement.
-   **Algorithms (Brain):** It provides a structured way for different parts of the robot's "brain" (like navigation, perception, and decision-making algorithms) to communicate with each other.

:::note
ROS 2 is not a traditional operating system like Windows or Linux. It's a framework that runs on top of an existing OS and provides libraries and tools to help you build robot applications.

### Why Linux?

For professional robotics development, Linux, specifically **Ubuntu 22.04**, is the industry standard. This is due to its open-source nature, strong community support, and, most importantly, its capabilities for **real-time scheduling**. Real-time performance is critical for robots that need to react to the world instantly and predictably.

### The Goal

By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of the core concepts of ROS 2. You will not just learn the theory; you will write your first ROS 2 nodes and control a simulated robot's nervous system. This is the first and most critical step toward building truly intelligent physical agents.
