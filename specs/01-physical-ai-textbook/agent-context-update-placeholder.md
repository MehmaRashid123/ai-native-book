# Agent Context Update - Placeholder

**Note**: In a normal workflow, the script `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType claude` would be executed here to update the agent context with the new technology stack and API contracts created in this planning phase.

This would typically add information about:
- The new API endpoints defined in the contracts
- The data models created
- The technology stack (Docusaurus, FastAPI, Qdrant, etc.)
- Any new patterns or architectural decisions

Since PowerShell is not available in this environment, this manual placeholder is created instead.
