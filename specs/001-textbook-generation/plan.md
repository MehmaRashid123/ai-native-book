# Implementation Plan: Physical AI Textbook Generation

**Branch**: `001-textbook-generation` | **Date**: 2025-12-15 | **Spec**: `spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-textbook-generation/spec.md`

## Summary

The project aims to generate a complete textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, structured into modules covering ROS 2, Simulation, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA models. The generation process will be driven by AI agents with specific skills, as defined in the project configuration.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11 (for ROS 2 Humble/Iron)
**Primary Dependencies**: ROS 2 Humble/Iron, Docusaurus, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Gazebo
**Storage**: N/A (Content is generated as `.mdx` files in the `docs/` directory)
**Testing**: Manual validation of generated content based on prompts and acceptance criteria in `spec.md`.
**Target Platform**: Web (Docusaurus) for the textbook, Ubuntu 22.04 for ROS 2 development.
**Project Type**: Docusaurus Website / Content Generation
**Performance Goals**: "Real Time Factor" in Gazebo simulation tutorials should be monitored to be close to 1.0.
**Constraints**: Requires specific hardware for simulation (RTX 4070 Ti+) and deployment (Jetson Orin).
**Scale/Scope**: The project will generate the 10 documents defined in the feature specification.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. MISSION:** All generated content must align with the mission of creating a definitive textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.
- **II. AUDIENCE PROFILE:** Content must be appropriate for the defined audience of developers and engineering students.
- **III. CONTENT GUIDELINES & TONE:** Tone must be authoritative yet visionary, and adhere to the specified hardware stack and safety warnings.
- **IV. FORMATTING RULES (DOCUSAURUS SPECIFIC):** All generated files must be valid MDX and use Docusaurus components as specified.
- **V. CURRICULUM STRUCTURE (STRICT ENFORCEMENT):** The content must follow the 4-module structure.
- **VI. INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGY:** Each topic must follow the "Concept -> Digital Twin -> Physical Reality -> Startup Angle" strategy.
- **VII. LANGUAGE & TRANSLATION:** Content will be in English, with technical terms preserved.

## Project Structure

### Documentation (this feature)

The following files will be generated by this plan:

```text
specs/001-textbook-generation/
├── plan.md              # This file
├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output
└── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output
```

### Source Code (repository root)

This project focuses on content generation. The primary output will be `.mdx` files in the `AI-BOOK/docs/` directory. The structure of the generated documents is defined in the `output_file` paths in the feature specification.

**Structure Decision**: The existing Docusaurus project structure will be used. No changes to the source code application structure are needed.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitutional violations detected.
